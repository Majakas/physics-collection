# physics-collection

This repository is meant for problem book creation and management. All the problems are kept in separate files following a specific structure and can be then compiled into LaTeX files using python scripts found in the book directories.

The general structure follows a class ProblemManager (found in python_dependencies/) that's fed the directories of the problem .tex files and which then handles the sorting of problems and distributing them between "collections" specified by the user. The "collections" are additional classes which support retrieving the LaTeX code for statements, hints, solutions in both Estonian and English.

### helper-backtracer.py

This file allows one to edit the .tex files generated by the python scripts and then update the corresponding problem .tex files by running the script. When the script is run and it encounters modified text, it will ask for confirmation for the text to be updated in the source file. To cancel the update, you need to close to script. For now, updating the problem year, number and round are not recommended as this creates conflicts with opening the source file. Furthermore, when updating the problem statement in English, one needs to modify the statement after the \ifEngStatement line. TODO: add different cancellation policy
